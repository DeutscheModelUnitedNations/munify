# MUNify

MUNify is a collection of tools to organize and run a [model united nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_United_Nations) conference. It aims to simplify aspects like participant management, document organization, commitee sessions (including speakers lists, voting and attendance tracking) and communication at the conference.

The project is still under development. It is currently not recommended to use it for a conference. If you are interested in using it, please contact us via the discussion section of this repository.

The project has been initiated by members of [DMUN](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Model_United_Nations).

It is composed of multiple software components which can be found in their separate directories inside this monorepo.

## Components

See the existing components and their directory below

- [CHASE (CHAiring SoftwarE)](./chase) -> A tool to manage the speakers list, voting and attendance tracking in commitees. It also supports messaging and resolution editing/sharing.

### Planned Components

- A participant management system/database
- A renewal of the DMUN conferences Websites ([mun-sh.de](https://mun-sh.de), [munbw.de](https://munbw.de) and [munbb.de](https://mun-bb.de))
- An inventory management system for conference materials

### Internal Tools

- [todo-sync](./todo-sync) -> A tool to sync #todo comments from the code to [this static website](https://deutschemodelunitednations.github.io/munify/)

## Develop Locally

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/), [bun](https://bun.sh/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) installed

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DeutscheModelUnitedNations/munify
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd munify
```

Install root dependencies

```bash
  bun i
```

Now go to the component you would like to run and follow the instructions/run the start scripts.
All root level scripts can be found in the [package.json](./package.json) file. Run them with `bun run <nameOfScript>`.

### Development in a Devcontainer
A devcontainer is a containerized development environment. It is a good way to ensure that all developers have the same environment and to avoid the "it works on my machine" problem. A devcontainer is defined in the [.devcontainer](./.devcontainer) directory. To use it, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed. The Container is preconfigured with all the tools you need to develop the project.

## FAQ

#### Can I use this for my conference outside of DMUN?

Yes. We encourage and allow usage for other conferences. Please see our license for more detailed information on this.

Note that the project is still under development and it is not recommended to use it without our consultation for a conference at the moment. The current state of the of the App is tested on a few DMUN conferences. If you are interested in using it, please contact us via the discussion section of this repository. We are happy to help you with the setup and usage, as long as you use it for your own conferences in line with our non-profit spirit.

Note also that this is primarily a project for DMUN conferences and might not be 100% suitable for your conferences needs and compatable with your rules of procedure. If you want guidlines on how to adapt the Code to your needs, please contact us via the discussion section of this repository. We are also happy to help.

#### Ok, but how?

You would need to deploy the app yourself, on your own servers and do all the neccessary setups. This can be an owerwhelming task so feel free to contact us when you need help. In some cases it might be possible for us to run the infrastructure and grant you access, please contact us in case you would like to know more about this. Depending on the use case and complexity, we might need to charge a service fee.
